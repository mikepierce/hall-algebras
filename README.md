# Hall Algebras in GAP 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Some [GAP](https://github.com/gap-system/gap) functions to calculate the Hall algebra 
of a quiver algebra generated by [QPA](https://github.com/gap-packages/qpa).

Right now the most useful function is `HallNumber(A,B,X)` which, for a fixed `q`,
computes the Hall number for the short exact sequence 0 → B → X → A → 0.


## TODO

  - **Ultimate Goal** Write it to where, for a finite-type bound quiver,
  I can literally get an [associative algbera](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap62.html#X7CC58DFD816E6B65) 
  object in GAP that is the Hall algebra of the quiver, 
  and maybe so I can compare this algebra to some quantum groups using
  [QuaGroup](https://github.com/gap-packages/quagroup)

  - First, finish the `HallPolynomial()` function.
  Look at the error being returned for `HallPolynomial(S1,S2,S1S2)`.
  I'm not sure the best way to "change" `q` for this.

  - Many of the functions could be sped up by taking an optional argument
  of the (finite) list of indecomposable modules over a path algebra.

  - **Concern** In general I'm suspicious of `HallNumber()`'s accuracy. 
  For HallNumber(S1,S1S2,S1S1S2) I calculated (q+1), but
  q → output : 13->196  5->36  3->16 ... q → (q+1)²
